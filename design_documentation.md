Design Elements
Hero Section

Purpose: Capture attention with a bold headline and futuristic visuals.
Components:
Gradient background (#1C2526 to #2E3A59) for a sleek, modern look.
Headline: “Innovate. Transform. Excel.” in bold, 48px Inter.
Subtext: Emphasizes BFSI expertise and customer experience.
CTA Button: Cyan (#00AEEF) with glow effect and hover scale animation.
Image: Placeholder for a futuristic BFSI-related graphic (e.g., digital dashboard or AI interface) with a floating animation.



Features Section

Purpose: Showcase key technology capabilities (AI, integration, security).
Components:
Three cards with glow effects and hover scaling for interactivity.
White background cards on a light gray (#F5F6F5) section for contrast.
Bold headings and concise descriptions in #2E3A59.



Call-to-Action Section

Purpose: Encourage user engagement with a clear invitation to connect.
Components:
Full-width cyan (#00AEEF) background for emphasis.
Centered text with a bold headline and a dark (#1C2526) CTA button.
Glow and hover effects for interactivity.



Footer

Purpose: Provide basic branding and copyright info.
Components:
Dark slate (#1C2526) background with centered white text.



Animations

Floating Effect: Applied to the hero image to create a dynamic, futuristic feel (3s ease-in-out).
Hover Scaling: Buttons and feature cards scale up slightly on hover (1.05x) for interactivity.
Glow Effect: Subtle shadow (rgba(0, 174, 239, 0.3)) on buttons and cards to enhance the futuristic aesthetic.

Responsiveness

Mobile: Stacks hero content vertically, reduces font sizes (e.g., H1 to 36px), and ensures cards are full-width.
Tablet: Adjusts padding and maintains two-column layouts for features.
Desktop: Full-width layout with max-width of 1280px for optimal viewing.

Figma Translation

Layers: Organize components into sections (Hero, Features, CTA, Footer) with clearly labeled groups.
Auto-Layout: Use Figma’s Auto-Layout for responsive spacing and alignment.
Components: Create reusable components for buttons, cards, and typography styles.
Export: Export assets (e.g., placeholder images) as PNGs for Figma import.
Prototyping: Add hover effects and transitions in Figma to mirror the coded animations.

How to Use

Code Preview: Run the HTML file locally using a tool like Vite or Live Server to preview the design.
Figma Import: Use a plugin like “HTML to Figma” to import the rendered design, then refine layers and add interactions.
Customization: Adjust placeholder images, text, and branding assets in Figma to match Qualtech Edge’s logo and specific content.

Notes

The placeholder image in the hero section should be replaced with a custom BFSI-related graphic (e.g., a digital banking interface or AI visualization).
For production, optimize images and ensure accessibility (e.g., alt text, ARIA labels).
The design adheres to Figma best practices for components and auto-layout, making it easy to adapt in Figma.
