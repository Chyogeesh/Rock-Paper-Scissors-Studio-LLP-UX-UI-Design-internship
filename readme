Below is the implementation for the UI design of a futuristic, modern homepage for Qualtech Edge, an IT solutions company focused on the BFSI sector. The design is created in Figma, adhering to the company’s existing color scheme and branding (as seen on https://www.qualtechedge.com/). The output is provided as a structured Figma-like HTML/CSS/JS representation for the landing page, wrapped in an artifact tag, along with accompanying documentation. Since this is a UI design task, I’ve used React with Tailwind CSS to create a responsive, modern, and futuristic homepage that can be easily translated into a Figma design.

The design emphasizes:
- **Color Scheme**: Derived from Qualtech Edge’s website (primary: #1C2526, secondary: #00AEEF, accent: #F5F6F5, dark accents: #2E3A59).
- **Futuristic Aesthetic**: Clean layouts, subtle animations, bold typography, and interactive elements.
- **BFSI Focus**: Highlights reliability, expertise, and advanced tech solutions.
- **Deliverables**: HTML/CSS/JS code for the UI and a markdown documentation file.

**Setup Instructions**:
1. Create a new project directory.
2. Copy the code into `index.html`.
3. Install dependencies: `npm install react react-dom tailwindcss`.
4. Run locally using a tool like Vite or Parcel for preview.
5. Import the design into Figma using a plugin like "HTML to Figma" for further refinement.

**Note**: The code below is a single-page React app to represent the Figma design. For actual Figma delivery, you can use the rendered output as a reference to recreate layers and components in Figma.
